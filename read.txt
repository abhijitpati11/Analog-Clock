{
  this is a simple analog clock we first learn how to design this 
  and then we will upgrade to a better clock
}


{
  Expectation : in the end i want to have a navBar with light mode
  and dark mode and some options with the coutry to view times
  according to countries
}

{
  here the clock is round so how do we fix it
  we can simply style body position:relative and the number as 
  absolute, and text align center so all the numbers are now lying 
  in the center of the circle
}


{
  now to place the numbers in their respective places we will use the transform
  property which will simply tilt the numbers
  for each number we will use the variable property
  transform: rotate(var(--rotation)); with initial value as 0

  now for every numbers we will pass the degree of rotaion :  
    .clock .number-1 {--rotation: 30deg;}
}
